In the world of computer games, there are many strategies similar to the series of games The Settlers, where you need to create and develop a settlement, fight or create alliances with other settlements, conquer territories, etc. However, all these stories have a written plot and all actions lead to two results: either winning according to the prescribed plot, or losing. My idea is a game where every action has its consequences and affects the ending.The game has two modes: a game with artificial intelligence, where you influence your own plot, and with real players online. In this way, the player will be able to familiarize himself with the various mechanics of the game thanks to the AI, so that later he can successfully play with other users. You can also add a civilization development mode: progress does not stand still, and thanks to the playerâ€™s actions, you can go through all the stages from ancient society to intergalactic adventures. This then makes it possible to create servers with real-time games. 
The development of the plot can occur in a variety of scenarios, for example, if the player decides to delve into medicine, then his settlers will be healthier and the standard of living will be higher, and this will also help solve the problem of pandemics. This is also a contribution to the economy, because good medicines will be in demand. Another option is the development of weapons. The settlement will then have greater combat power, and therefore be able to capture a large number of territories and have more resources. This option is suitable for those who want to complete the plot along the path of war, but it minimizes the number of friendly relations.# StartUP
